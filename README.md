A series of 30 second fleets from my twitter account where I show different coding concepts in JavaScript.

To try the exercises yourself you can clone the repo and work on the main branch. Switch to the solved branch to see the answers from the fleets. PR's are welcome!

Follow me on Twitter to see new fleets as they come out:
